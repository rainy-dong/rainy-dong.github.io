# Hello, I'm Rainy

<img src="/assets/profile.jpeg" alt="Profile photo" width="120" align="left" style="margin-right: 20px;" />

I'm a postdoctoral researcher (advisor: Elika Bergelson) at Harvard LDS working on early language environment and acquisition, since January 2025.

Before Harvard, I obtained my DPhil in Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford, where I focused on the children's emotion words in written language. 
I was advised by Kate Nation and Robert Hepach.

Before that, I completed my BSc in Psychology at University College London.
